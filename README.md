Saint Louis City 911 Calls - Dashboard

This project is a start to downloading and analyzing 911 call data for the City of St Louis.
The functionality is very limited currently but hope to make it fully functional for research.
Currently, type in a street address and will return:
1-list of calls at that location
2-map of the city with a red dot on the block
3-zoomed inset of the city with a red dot on the block
